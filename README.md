SLAMHW1/rotation

Calculating Rotation matrix with Homography Matrix.

SLAMHW2/harris

Extract Harris Corner feature along the image. The dataset is TUM RGBD Freiburg2 desk sequence: https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download

Stablish  correspondences  between  each  pair  of  images  by simple  SSD  patch  comparison. For  each  match,  draw  a  line  segment  between  the coordinates of the matched features (both in the first image).

SLAMHW2/hypothesize

Implement  a  simplified  hypothesize-and‐test  algorithm  to  compute  the  fundamental  matrix between each pair of views using the seven‐point algorithm
